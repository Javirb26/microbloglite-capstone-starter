## Naming Conventions:
### branch: snake_case (Ex: yourname_feature) 
### folders: camelCase (Ex: allAssets) 
### files: snake_case (Ex: show_one_character.html) 
### id=”kebab-case” (Ex: input-btn) 
### class=”kebab-case” (Ex: background-img) 
### use let mostly: 
### when using let variable names for let = camelCase (Ex: inputBtn) 
### when using const  
### variable names for const = CAPITALIZE (Ex: INPUTBTN) 
### function convention is going to be arrow functions: 
### let capitalize = () ⇒ {} 
### use double quotes when grabbing: 
### Ex: document.getElementById(”div”)
